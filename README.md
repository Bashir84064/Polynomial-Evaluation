# Polynomial-Evaluation

This project evaluates the accuracy of a polynomial evaluation using (a) coefficient formula (b)compact formula
For the polynomial in consideration:

p(x) = (x − 2)^9
Its coefficient form is :
 x9 − 18x^8 + 144x^7 − 672x^6 + 2016x^5 −
4032x^4 + 5376x^3 − 4608x^2 + 2304x − 512.

For the compact form calculation,matlab function handle is used similary for the coefficient based evaluation ,matlab's method polyval is used at different points expressed as vector x:[1:920; 1:921; 1:922; : : : ; 2:080]
